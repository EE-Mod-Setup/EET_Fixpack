@766 = ~SANDRAH, PRIESTESS OF MYSTRA
Sandrah has taken a long time to finally decide on her dedication to the Goddess of All Magic. During that decision period she has undergone training in melee combat with one of the greatest fighters in the Realms (but that is another story).
When she finally started her studies at the Temple of Waterdeep, she soon specialized in the healing powers provided by the Weave. As a healer, she will first try to restore her friends before plunging into combat again. However, when she picks up her blessed hammer her training soon becomes apparent.
Her special personal relationship to Mystra (again another story) provides her access to all the magic that falls into her goddess' domain. She thus has the ability to assimilate certain spells that are not available to priests of other deities.~
